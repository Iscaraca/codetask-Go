# Programming Tasks in Go

This is a challenge to complete one (or more if I'm feeling good about myself) programming task(s) a day, but the catch is that I can only do it in Go.
I have never used Go before this, so I'm doing this in hopes of getting fluent at it eventually. As I complete tasks, I will note down the things I've learnt in this README together with the date of completion to track progress.

## Why I'm learning Go
1. It's supposedly great for web development
2. I use statically typed languages a lot (and I prefer to use them over dynamically typed languages)
3. Go doesn't have excessive boilerplate code unlike Ruby
4. Fast compile times

## Tasks complete:
- 100doors (27/4/2020): Basic syntax and for loop
- A + B (28/4/2020): Initialise functions
- gpa (28/4/2020): Set precision of standard output float
- descsort (28/4/2020): Sorting a slice, using comparator functions to determine sorting sequence
- standardshapes (29/4/2020): OOP, composition by embedding structs, pointers to set object values
- gcd (29/4/2020): Recursion
- guessthenumber (30/4/2020): Binary search
- reversestring (no additional memory) (30/4/2020): Converting strings into mutable byte arrays
- reversedlinkedlist (1/5/2020): Linked lists, pointers, methods
- knightsdialler (2/5/2020): 2D slices, matrix multiplication
- lioddevensubseq (3/5/2020): dynamic programming
