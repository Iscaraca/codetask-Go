# Programming Tasks in Go

This is a challenge to complete one programming task a day, but the catch is that I can only do it in Go.
I have never used Go before this, so I'm doing this in hopes of getting fluent at it eventually. As I complete tasks, I will note down the things I've learnt in this README together with the date of completion to track progress.

Tasks complete:
- 100 Doors (27/4/2020): Basic syntax and for loop
- A + B (28/4/2020): Initialise functions
- gpa (28/4/2020): Set precision of standard output float
- descsort (28/4/2020): Sorting a slice, using comparator functions to determine sorting sequence
