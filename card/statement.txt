Alice is a card dealer at the poker table in the newly opened ResortWorld casino. As a strange personal quirk, she has two ways of moving a card when she shuffles the deck:

A: She takes the card at the top of the deck and moves it to the bottom.

B: She takes the second card from the top of the deck and moves it to the bottom

Initially, Alice has m cards (note that m can be very much more than the standard 52 cards found in a deck) which are labeled consecutively: the card at the top is labeled 0 and the card at the bottom is labeled m-1.
Task

In this question we want to know: given a sequence of moves and a k, where 0 < k < m-1, what is the label of the (k-1)-th, k-th and (k+1)-th cards from the top of the deck after the entire sequence is applied? Here, we treat the top-most card as the 0-th card. in our example above, if k = 3, then the answer is "3 1 5"
Input

The first line of the input consists of two integers m and k, where 0 < k < m-1, and 3 ≤ m ≤ 1,000,000. This is followed (in the same line) by the sequence of moves. The last character in the input is the period ".", indicating the end of input.

Output

The output consists of 3 integers, representing the (k-1)-th, k-th and (k+1)-th cards from the top of the deck after the entire sequence of moves have been applied.
Sample Input 1

6 3 ABBABA.

Sample Output 1

3 1 5

Explanation for Sample Output 1

Initially, the deck is arranged as such: 0 1 2 3 4 5

After each subsequent move, the deck will be arranged as such:
A: 1 2 3 4 5 0
B: 1 3 4 5 0 2
B: 1 4 5 0 2 3
A: 4 5 0 2 3 1
B: 4 0 2 3 1 5
A: 0 2 3 1 5 4
